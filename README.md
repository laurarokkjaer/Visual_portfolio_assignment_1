# Visual Analytics - Spring 2022
# Portfolio Assignment 1

This repository contains the code and descriptions from the first assigned project of the Spring 2022 module Visual Analytics as part of the bachelor's tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University - whereas the overall Visual analytics portfolio (zip-file) consist of 4 projects, 3 class assignments as well as 1 self-assigned.

## Repo structure
### This repository has the following directory structure:

| **Folder** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ```in``` | Contains the input data (will be empty) |
| ```out``` | Contains the results (outputs like plots or reports)  |
| ```src``` | Contains code for assignment 1 |
Also containing a MITLICENSE for guidelines of how to reproduce and use the data in this repository


## Assignment description
The official description of the assignment:
For this assignment, you will write a small Python program to compare image histograms quantitively using Open-CV and the other image processing tools you've already encountered. Your script should do the following:

Take a user-defined image from the folder
Calculate the "distance" between the colour histogram of that image and all of the others.
Find which 3 image are most "similar" to the target image.
Save an image which shows the target image, the three most similar, and the calculated distance score.
Save a CSV which has one column for the filename and three columns showing the filenames of the closest images in descending order
For this assignment, you should create a private Github repository and add me as a collaborator. When submitting via Brightspace, simply send the link to the repository; I will provide feedback and comments via Github's built in functionality.

### The goal of the assignment 
The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate a good understanding of how to use simple image processing techniques to extract valuable information from image data. The results is to have a simple tool for performing image search on a dataset of images, finding which images are most similar to one another.
